                  DentistLink is a free service brought to you by Arcora the Foundation of Delta Dental of Washington. 
                  The <a href="http://arcorafoundation.org">Arcora Foundation</a> works to improve the oral and overall health of the people of Washington.  
                  With partners, weâ€™ve pioneered programs that increase access to oral health care such as the 
                  <a href="http://abcd-dental.org">Access to Baby and Child Dentistry Program (ABCD)</a> which connects Apple Health (Medicaid) enrolled children ages 0-5 to dentists. Washington now leads the country for young Medicaid-enrolled children accessing dental care. Our goal at DentistLink is to find solutions for Apple Health (Medicaid) enrolled adults seeking dental care.
